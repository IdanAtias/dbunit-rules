= *Introduction*

*DBUnit Rules* aims for bringing http://dbunit.sourceforge.net/[DBUnit^] closer to your JUnit tests. Here are the main features:

* https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Rules[JUnit rule] to integrate with DBUnit via annotations:
+
[source,java]
----
    @Rule
    public DBUnitRule dbUnitRule = DBUnitRule.instance(jdbcConnection);//<1>

    @Test
    @DataSet(value = "datasets/yml/users.yml")
    public void shouldSeedDataSet(){
        //database is seed with users.yml dataset
    }
----
<1> The rule depends on a JDBC connection.
+
* https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules#cdi-module[CDI integration^] via interceptor to seed database without rule instantiation;
* JSON, YAML, XML, XLS, and CSV support;
* https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules#configuration[Configuration^] via annotations or yml files;
* https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules#cucumber-module[Cucumber^] integration;
* Multiple database support;
* Date/time support in datasets;
* Scriptable datasets with groovy and javascript;
* Regular expressions in expected datasets;
* https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules#junit-5[JUnit 5^] integration;
* https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules#export-datasets[DataSet export^];
* https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules#8-leak-hunter[Connection leak detection^];
* Lot of https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules#example[examples^].


The project is composed by 5 modules:

* https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules/tree/master/core[Core^]: Contains the dataset executor and JUnit rule;
* https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules/tree/master/cdi[CDI^]: provides the DBUnit interceptor;
* https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules/tree/master/cucumber[Cucumber^]: a CDI aware cucumber runner;
* https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules/tree/master/junit5[JUnit5^]: Comes with an http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions[extension^] for JUnit5.
* https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules/tree/master/examples[Examples module^].
