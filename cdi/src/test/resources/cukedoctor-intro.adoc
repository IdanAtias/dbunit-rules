= *Introduction*

*DBUnit Rules* aims for bringing http://dbunit.sourceforge.net/[DBUnit^] closer to your JUnit tests. Here are the main features:

* https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Rules[JUnit rule] to integrate with DBUnit via annotations:
+
[source,java]
----
    @Rule
    public DBUnitRule dbUnitRule = DBUnitRule.instance(jdbcConnection);//<1>

    @Test
    @DataSet(value = "datasets/yml/users.yml")
    public void shouldSeedDataSet(){
        //database is seed with users.yml dataset
    }
----
<1> The rule depends on a JDBC connection.
+
* CDI interceptor to seed database without rule instantiation;
* Json, Yaml, xml and flat xml support;
* https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules#configuration[Configuration^] via annotations or yml files;
* Cucumber integration;
* JPA integration;
* Multiple database support;
* Date/time support in datasets;
* http://junit.org/junit5/[JUnit 5^] integration.
* Export dataSets
* Connection leak detection

* https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules/tree/master/cdi[CDI^]: provides the DBUnit interceptor;
* https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules/tree/master/cucumber[Cucumber^]: a CDI aware cucumber runner;
* https://github.com/rmpestano/dbunit-rules/tree/master/junit5[JUnit5^]: Comes with an http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions[extension^] for JUnit5.
